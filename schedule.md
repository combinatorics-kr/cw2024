**Title**:  Asymptotic bounds of Ramsey Numbers<br/>
**Abstract**: Ramsey numbers, denoted as  $R(s,t)$, are fundamental in graph theory, representing the smallest number of vertices $n$ such that every graph 
on $n$ vertices either contains a clique of size $s$ or an independent set of size $t$. Recent developments in Ramsey theory have focused on finding asymptotic bounds for Ramsey numbers.<br/>
In this talk, we survey asymptotic bounds of Ramsey Numbers $R(3,t)$ and $R(4,t)$, including significant contributions of Sam Mattheus and Jacques Verstraete on $R(4,t)$.

**Title**: Extensions of the colorful Helly theorem for d-collapsible and d-Leray complexes<br/>
**Abstract**: We present extensions of the colorful Helly theorem for $d$-collapsible and $d$-Leray complexes, providing a common generalization to the topological colorful Helly theorem by Kalai and Meshulam, the very colorful Helly theorem by Arocha et al., and the semi-intersecting colorful Helly theorem by Karasev and Montejano. As an application, we obtain a strengthened version of Tverberg's theorem. This is joint work with Alan Lew.

**Title**: Toric Colorability of Graphs of Simplicial $d$-Polytopes with $𝑑+4$ vertices<br/>
**Abstract**: The 1-skeleton of a convex polytope $P$ is called the graph of $P$.
A graph of a simplicial $d$-polytope is said to be $\textit{toric colorable}$ if there is a vertex coloring $\lambda \colon V(G) \to \mathbb{Z}^d$ such that $\{v_1, \ldots, v_d\}$ forms a face of $P$ implies that $\{\lambda(v_1), \ldots, \lambda(v_d)\}$ is unimodular.<br/>
In this talk, we discuss the toric colorability of graphs of simplicial $d$-polytopes with $d+4$ vertices.

**Title**: Lusztig $q$ weight multiplicities via affine crystals<br/>
**Abstract**: Lusztig $q$ weight multiplicity is a polynomial in $q$ whose positivity has been verified by linking it to a specific affine Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomial. However, a combinatorial formula beyond type A has not been known until recently.<br/>
In $2019$, Lee proposed a combinatorial formula for type C using a novel combinatorial concept known as semistandard oscillating tableaux. We will outline the proof of Lee's conjecture and discuss how it can be extended to type B spin weights case.<br/>
Based on joint work with Hyeonjae Choi and Seung Jin Lee.

**Title**: Enumeration of multiplex juggling card sequences using generalized $q$-derivatives<br/>
**Abstract**: In $2019$, Butler, Choi, Kim, and Seo introduced a new type of juggling card that represents multiplex juggling patterns in a
  natural bijective way. They conjectured a formula for the generating function for the number of multiplex juggling cards with capacity.
  In this paper we prove their conjecture. More generally, we find an explicit formula for the generating function with any capacity. We
  also find an expression for the generating function for multiplex juggling card sequences by introducing a generalization of the $q$-derivative operator. As a consequence, we show that this generating function is a rational function.

**Title**: 102-avoiding Inversion Sequences<br/>
**Abstract**: A sequence $(e_1,e_2,\cdots ,e_n)$ is an inversion sequences if $0 \le e_i < i$ for all $i = 1,...,n$. We say that an inversion sequences $e = (e_1, e_2, \cdots , e_n)$ $\textit{contains}$ the pattern 102 if there exist some indices $i < j < k$ such that $e_j < e_i < e_k$. Otherwise, $e$ is said to $\textit{avoid}$ the pattern 102.
In this talk, we will construct a correspondence between the set of 2-Schr\”{o}der paths without peaks and valleys ending with a diagonal step and the set of 102-avoiding inversion sequences. This is the joint work with JiSun Huh, Sangwook Kim, and Seunghyun Seo.

**Title**: Transversal Hamilton paths and cycles of arbitrary orientations in tournaments <br/>
**Abstract**: It is well-known that a tournament always contains a directed Hamilton path. Rosenfeld conjectured that if a tournament is sufficiently large,
  it contains a Hamilton path of any given orientation. This conjecture was approved by Thomason, and Havet and Thomassé completely resolved it by showing there are exactly three exceptions.<br/>
We generalized this result into a transversal setting. Let $T = \{T_1, . . . , T_{n−1}\}$ be a collection of tournaments on a common vertex set $V$ of size $n$. We showed that if $n$ is sufficiently large, there is a Hamilton path on $V$ of any given orientation which is obtained by collecting exactly one arc from each $T_i$. Such a path is said to be transversal.<br/>
It is also a folklore that a strongly connected tournament always contains a directed Hamilton cycle. Rosenfeld made a conjecture for arbitrarily oriented Hamilton cycles in tournaments as well, which was approved by Thomason (for sufficiently large tournaments) and Zein (by specifying all the exceptions). We also showed a transversal version of this result. Together with the aforementioned result, it extends our previous research, which is on transversal generalizations of existence of directed paths and cycles in tournaments.<br/>
This is a joint work with Debsoumya Chakraborti, Jaehoon Kim, and Hyunwoo Lee.

**Title**: Towards a classification of 1-homogeneous graphs with positive intersection number $a_1$ <br/>
**Abstract**: Let $\Gamma$ be a graph with diameter at least two. Then Γ is said to be 1-homogeneous (in the sense of Nomura) whenever for every pair of adjacent vertices $x$ and $y$ in $\Gamma$, the distance partition of the vertex set of $\Gamma$ with respect to both $x$ and $y$ is equitable, and the parameters corresponding to equitable partitions are independent of the choice of $x$ and $y$. Assume $\Gamma$ is 1-homogeneous distance-regular with intersection number $a_1 > 0$ and diameter $D \geqslant 5$. Define $b = b_1/(\theta_1 + 1)$, where $b_1$ is the intersection number and $\theta_1$ is the second largest eigenvalue of $\Gamma$. In this talk, we show that if intersection number $c_2 \geqslant 2$, then $b \geqslant 1$ and one of the following (i)–(vi) holds: (i) $\Gamma$ is a regular near $2D$-gon, (ii) $\Gamma$ is a Johnson graph $J(2D, D)$, (iii) $\Gamma$ is a halved $l$-cube where $l \in \{2D, 2D+1\}$, (iv) $\Gamma$ is a folded Johnson graph $\overline{J}(4D, 2D)$, (v) $\Gamma$ is a folded halved $(4D)$-cube, (vi) the valency of $\Gamma$ is bounded by a function of $b$. Moreover, we characterize 1-homogeneous graphs with classical parameters and $a_1 > 0$, as well as tight distance-regular graphs. This is a joint work with J. Koolen, M. Abdullah, B. Gebremichel.
